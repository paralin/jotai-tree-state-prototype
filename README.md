# Prototype Implementation

This is a basic implementation of the prototype described in [this design document](https://gist.github.com/paralin/4a345be26ab7784206e4c39eedf8a45d).

## Development

To start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite in development mode. The app will be available at http://localhost:5173 by default.

For more details about the design and architecture, please refer to the design document linked above.
